Welcome to Bing Bong Balls!

In this game, you use launchers to launch balls.

When balls and blocks collide, a musical note is played!

There are 3 operations:
- Create Launcher
- Create Block
- Select


Click the "Create Launcher" button, then click any empty space to place a launcher.

You can create multiple blocks in the same way. When you're done creating a specific block, click "Select".


After creating a launcher, the operation becomes "Select".

You can move or customize selected launchers/blocks.

If a launcher is selected, you can touch any empty space to launch a ball.


Use the recording button to record the notes played.

In Free Play mode, you can choose to save the music.

In Puzzle mode, stopping a recording automatically submits the recording.
